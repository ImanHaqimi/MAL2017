# Android-Based Restaurant Reservation App  

## Overview  
The *Android-Based Restaurant Reservation App* simplifies table reservations for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Designed with a focus on ease of use, the app allows customers to:  
- Select a date and meal type.  
- Choose a seating location (Seaside, Garden View, or Inside) and table size.  
- Confirm, modify, or cancel reservations directly through the app.  

This project showcases incremental development, with the repository serving as a comprehensive timeline of the app's progress leading to the final build.
